The program uses console.table and inquirer to interact with the user.
It collects six inputs from the user.
These inputs are added together to calculate the total bill.
It checks if the total bill is greater than 1200 rupees.
If the total bill is greater than 1200 rupees, the customer gets a 20% discount; otherwise, they get their bill as is.
The customer is then prompted to choose between paying with cash or card.
If they choose cash, they enter the amount and receive change.
If they choose card, they enter their card PIN and receive the bill.
